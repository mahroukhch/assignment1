<h1> <b> STORY </b> </h1>
<h2> <b> <I> THE HAREüêá AND THE TORTOISE üê¢ </I> </b> </h2>
<p> There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. <br> One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. <br> Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought he‚Äôll win this easily.<br> So he took a nap while the tortoise kept on going.<br> When the hare woke up, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line.<br> Much to his chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping. </p> <hr>
<h1> MORAL OF THE STORY </h1> <hr>
<p> There are actually a couple of moral lessons we can learn from this story.<br> The hare teaches that overconfidence can sometimes ruin you. While the tortoise teaches us about the power of perseverance.<br> Even if all the odds are stacked against you, never give up.<br> Sometimes life is not about who‚Äôs the fastest or the strongest, it‚Äôs about who is the most consistent.
<p> <q> Respect for ourselves guides our morals, respect for others guides our manners. </q> </p>
